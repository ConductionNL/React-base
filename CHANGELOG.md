## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **chore(argo): migrate source GitHub → Codeberg.** GitHub org `ConductionNL`
  is shadowbanned (`react-platform` + canary reactfront apps `SYNC=Unknown`).
  Repointed `repoURL` `github.com/ConductionNL/React-base` →
  `codeberg.org/Conduction/React-base` in `react-platform/argo/projects/react-platform.yaml`,
  `applicationsets/react-tenants.yaml`, `applications/root.yaml`. Public HTTPS,
  no credentials. GitHub kept for rollback.

### Added

- **2026-05-01** — Initial openspec change `bootstrap-react-platform`. Proposal/design/tasks for mirroring the Nextcloud-base GitOps shape onto the WOO PWA: ApplicationSet + layered Helm values (`common.yaml` → `env/*.yaml` → `tenants/tenant-*.yaml`), vendored `woo-website` chart, AppProject sync-window governance. Replaces the `mcc create-react` per-tenant manifest generator. Tenant files become 2 lines (`name`, `environment`) for the common case; namespace pairs with the Nextcloud co-tenant (`<org>-<env>`); image tag pinned to semver in `common.yaml` (no more `latest`); branding migration sources truth from live cluster state. No code or values scaffolded yet — planning docs only. Files: `openspec/changes/bootstrap-react-platform/{.openspec.yaml,proposal.md,design.md,tasks.md}`.
- **2026-05-01** — Document external dependencies in `bootstrap-react-platform`: DNS handled by `cluster-infra/external-dns` (Cloudflare, `policy: sync`, zones `commonground.nu`/`openwoo.app`/`opencatalogi.nl`) — tenant adds/removes auto-create/auto-reap DNS records. TLS via cert-manager + HTTP-01. Recorded in `design.md` (new "External dependencies" subsection), `proposal.md` (Removed from Scope), and `tasks.md` (task 7.1 will surface this in `docs/ADDING-TENANT.md`).
- **2026-05-01** — Scaffold `react-platform/` (openspec phases 2–7). Vendored `charts/woo-website/` from `woo-website-template-apiv2@b1ac4e89` (refactor branch) plus added `templates/networkpolicy.yaml` for pod-label-scoped default-deny + allow-ingress + allow-egress policies. Wrote `react-platform/values/{common,env/accept,env/prod}.yaml` and `templates/tenant-template.yaml` (image pinned to `1.0.0`, `nodeSelector: role: prod-nextcloud`, ingress className `nginx`, security context platform-grade). Wrote AppProject `react-platform` and ApplicationSet `react-tenants` (mirrors Nextcloud-base shape, namespace `<name>-<env>`, Application name `<name>-<env>-reactfront`). Wrote `scripts/{validate-values,smoke-checks}.sh` (smoke-check reproduces ApplicationSet inline values in bash for offline render testing). Wrote `docs/{ADDING-TENANT,ROLLOUTS,MIGRATION}.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and updated `README.md`. Synthetic tenant `tenant-test-mcc.yaml` added as canary placeholder; smoke-checks pass (9 resources clean). Phase 1 (cluster discovery) and 8–10 (cut-overs) are deferred to live operations.
